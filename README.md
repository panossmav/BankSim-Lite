# BankSim - Lite 
### 1. Basic Info:
This app is made in python using the `sqlite3` library. It works as a data manager for very small banks, in theory. 

### 2. Install / Setup:
		git clone https://github.com/panossmav/BankSim-Lite.git

You can run this command to copy the directory to your machine. 
You should also run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` for the application to run properly.
By running `basic-commands.py`, a new `database.db` file will be created on the root of the BankSim-Lite folder.
You are good to go! Launching `app.py` will open the graphical interface of the application

### 3. Warnings:
1) The app should be use strictly **for educational purposes**
2) This is a **WIP (Work In Progress)** application, so bugs inside are expected.
3) You can create an Issue for any bug
